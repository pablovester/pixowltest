--- EXPLANATION FOR MY SOLUTION --

I've implemented a VueJS application because I've found it presents a simple syntax for coding and, personally, I want to learn every detail of this framework.
It uses the 'props' which are very useful to pass down data to a component, which itself has to be coded only once, reducing time and making it easier to apply changes to texts and content. It is also more dynamic in the sense that a template can be created just once, for it to be reused as many times as desired.

Images are located in the folder /public/assets for them to be accesible for the components.
